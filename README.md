Project Assignement

The run_analisys.R script must be run on the root directory of the project.

The Working Directory should be set by changing the path to the script on line 8.

The script generates three different outputs:

       1. The Merged Data Set used, named MergedData, 
       2. the extracted measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, named MeanStdDev
       3. the Tidy Data Set, named TidyData
       

Tidy Data set is also written on the root directory of the project.
